# My-Python-Learning-Journey
# Python Programming Basics - OctuCode Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises from the **OctuCode** Python course. It includes basic logic using conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and user input handling.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. Student Grading System (`grading_system.py`)
A program that takes a student's score and determines their grade based on specific criteria:
* **Excellent**: Score >= 90
* **Good**: Score >= 75
* **Accepted**: Score >= 50
* **Weak**: Score < 50

### 2. Weather and Age Checker (`basic_conditions.py`)
Two simple logic checks in one script:
* **Rain Check**: Advises whether to take an umbrella based on user input ("yes" or "no").
* **Age Verification**: Checks if a user is 12 years or older to grant access to an application.

### 3. Number Analysis (`number_checker.py`)
A script that identifies if a number entered by the user is:
* **Positive** (Greater than 0).
* **Negative** (Less than 0).
* **Zero**.

## 🛠️ Concepts Learned
* Working with `input()` and data types like `float()` and `int()`.
* Using Conditional Statements: `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
* Comparison Operators (>=, <, ==).
